                                      <p>A seven-story residence hall, Founders Hall houses 268 students. Founders Hall is suite-style where two rooms share an adjoining bathroom. Each room is carpeted and includes one microwave refrigerator, loftable beds, desks, and open flexible closets.
                                  
                                  Many first and second-year students select Founders Hall for its sense of community, engaging hall events, and prime location on campus. Founders is adjacent to Highsmith Student Union, near Brown Dining Hall, and across from one of the two Approved Animal Exercise Areas. Founders Hall is also close to the Botanical Gardens, and the upper floors feature scenic mountain views.

                                          <p>A seven-story residence hall, Founders Hall houses 268 students. Founders Hall is suite-style where two rooms share an adjoining bathroom. Each room is carpeted and includes one microwave refrigerator, loftable beds, desks, and open flexible closets.
                                      
                                      Many first and second-year students select Founders Hall for its sense of community, engaging hall events, and prime location on campus.

Founders Hall is also close to the Botanical Gardens, and the upper floors feature scenic mountain views.

                                          <p>A seven-story residence hall, Founders Hall houses 268 students. Founders Hall is suite-style where two rooms share an adjoining bathroom. Each room is carpeted and includes one microwave refrigerator, loftable beds, desks, and open flexible closets.

Founders is adjacent to Highsmith Student Union, near Brown Dining Hall, and across from one of the two Approved Animal Exercise Areas. Founders Hall is also close to the Botanical Gardens, and the upper floors feature scenic mountain views.
